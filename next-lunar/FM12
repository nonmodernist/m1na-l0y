Each child of a superior woman should be the result of a definite period of psychic development in her life&mdash;& not necessarily of a possibly irksome & outworn continuance of an alliance&mdash;spontaneously adapted for vital creation in the beginning but not necessarily harmoniously balanced as the parties to it&mdash;follow their individual lines of personal evolution&mdash;
For the harmony of the race, each individual should be the expression of an easy & ample interpenetration of the male & female temperaments&mdash;free of stress
Woman must become more responsible for the child than man&mdash;
Women must destroy in themselves, the desire to be love&mdash;
The feeling that it is a personal insult when a man transfers
his attention from her to another woman
The desire for comfortable protection instead of an intelligent
curiosity & courage in meeting & resisting the pressure of life
sex or so called love must be reduced to its initial element,
honour, grief, sentimentality, pride and & consequently jealousy must be detached from it.
Woman for her happiness must retain her deceptive fragility of
appearance, combined with indomitable will, irreducible
courage, & abundant health the outcome of sound nerves—
Another great illusion is that woman must use all her
introspective and clear-sightedness & unbiassed bravery to
destroy—for the sake of her [[self|you]] [[respect|FMend]] is the impurity of sex
the realization in defiance of superstition that there is [[nothing]] [[impure]] [[in]] [[sex]]—except in the mental attitude to it—will constitute an incalculable & wider social regeneration than it is possible for our generation to imagine.
